fix: Turn advancement and card message fixes

## Critical Fixes:
- **Turn Advancement**: Fixed turn not passing properly after manual "End Turn" clicks
- **Card Messages**: Ensured card messages display correctly with actual card content
- **Board Text**: Adjusted board text sizes for better readability
- **Event Log**: Improved event log styling and message formatting

## Technical Changes:
- **Turn Logic**: Streamlined turn ending process to work reliably
- **Dice Result**: Removed unnecessary dice result text display
- **Event Colors**: Ensured player-specific event coloring works properly
- **Board Scaling**: Fine-tuned board element sizes for optimal zoom

Turn system now works properly - players can roll dice, take actions, and manually end their turn to pass to the next player. Card messages show the actual card effects.
