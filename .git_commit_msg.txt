fix: Board text size adjustment

## UI Improvements:
- **Board Text Size**: Increased board text sizes slightly for better readability
- Made property names, prices, and group labels more visible
- Adjusted font sizes from 0.7em to 0.8em for board spaces
- Improved text contrast and legibility

Board text is now more readable while maintaining the zoom-optimized layout.
