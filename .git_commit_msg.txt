fix: Critical bugs and UI improvements

## Bug Fixes:
- **Card Messages**: Fixed card messages not showing actual card text (was showing "kart çekti" instead of real messages like "Banka hatası! Sana ₺200 ödendi")
- **Turn Advancement**: Fixed turn not advancing when landing on Community Chest in 2-player games
- **Board Scaling**: Adjusted board text sizes to look good at 90% zoom level

## UI Improvements:
- **Event Log Design**: Enhanced event log styling with better borders, backgrounds, and hover effects
- **Board Text**: Made board text slightly larger for better readability
- **Dice Display**: Updated single die display (removed second die)

## Technical Changes:
- **Server Card Logic**: Updated server to send proper card message format
- **Client Event Handling**: Fixed card message display in board events and main event log
- **Turn Logic**: Ensured turn advancement works correctly after special space landings

All card messages now display properly, turn advancement works correctly, and board text is more readable at different zoom levels.
