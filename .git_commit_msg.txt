fix: Critical turn system and event log fixes

## Critical Bug Fixes:
- **Turn Advancement**: Fixed turn not passing properly when landing on Community Chest in 2-player games
- **Dice Result Text**: Removed unnecessary "Zar: X" text under dice display
- **Event Log Messages**: Fixed card messages showing actual card content in player's color
- **Event Log Ordering**: Ensured newest events stay on top, oldest are removed when limit reached

## Game Flow Improvements:
- **Turn Logic**: Enhanced turn advancement to work correctly for all special spaces
- **Card Display**: Community Chest and Chance cards now show their actual messages
- **Event Colors**: Events now display in the color of the player who triggered them
- **Board Events**: Shortened board event messages for better readability

## Technical Changes:
- **Turn Checks**: Added proper validation before ending turns
- **Message Formatting**: Improved event message extraction and coloring
- **Dice Display**: Simplified dice display to show only the rolled number
- **Event Management**: Better event log management with color coding

Turn system now works like proper Monopoly - turns advance correctly after special space actions. Card messages display properly and event log is more readable.
